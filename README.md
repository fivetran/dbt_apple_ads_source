# Apple Search Ads (Source) 

This package models Apple Search Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/apple-search-ads). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/apple-search-ads/#schemainformation).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:
- Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
- Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all ID fields are tested for non-null values.
- Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models
This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Apple Search Ads transform package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads).  The staging models are designed to:
- Remove any rows that are soft-deleted
- Name columns consistently across all packages:
    - Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
    - Timestamps are appended with `_at`
    - ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the `ad_group_history` table's ID column is renamed `ad_group_id`.
    - Foreign keys include the table that they refer to. For example, a keyword's `campaign` is named `campaign_id`. 

## Installation Instructions
Add the following configuration to your `packages.yml` file:
```yml
# packages.yml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/apple_search_ads_source
    version: [">=0.1.0", "<0.2.0"]
```

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration
By default, this package looks for your Apple Search Ads data in the `apple_search_ads` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Apple Search Ads data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    apple_search_ads_database: your_database_name
    apple_search_ads_schema: your_schema_name 
```
### Disable models
It's possible that your Apple Search Ads connector does not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in Apple Search Ads or actively excluded some tables from your syncs. To disable the corresponding functionality in the package, you must add the relevant variables. By default, the package assume that all variables are true. Add variables for only the tables you want to disable. 

The `apple_search_ads_using_search_terms` variable below refers to the `search_terms_report` table. You must enable the [search match](https://searchads.apple.com/help/campaigns/0006-understand-search-match) function within each ad group to populate this table with data. 

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  apple_search_ads__using_search_terms: false # Disable if you do not have the search_term_report table, or if you do not want search_term_report related metrics reported

```

### Change the Build Schema
By default, this package builds the Apple Search Ads staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_apple_search_ads`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your Apple Search Ads staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    apple_search_ads_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

## Database Support

This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, PostgreSQL, and Databricks.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
dbt `v0.20.0` introduced a new project-level dispatch configuration that enables an "override" setting for all dispatched macros. If you are using a Databricks destination with this package, you need to add the dispatch configuration below (or a variation of that configuration) within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```
